Repo for the her-hackathon2021 team "42 She-Wolves"

Best work on Mac OS

What it does:
It detects on your c file:
- Number of dynamic libraries included
- Unused dynamic libraries (even if it's included in your static libraries)
- Number of lines of code
- Number of while-loops
- Number of for-loops

How to start:
- git clone https://github.com/MelSchi/make_my_code_green
- cd make_my_code_green
- enter the command $make my code green
- when asked for a file name, enter path with file name
  e.g.
  ../test/ft_atoi.c

Check the result:
- Find the report in the root folder named "report.txt"

Future posible extensions:
- check different languages (detected through file extension)
- check automatically all files in a folder
- other benchmarks
